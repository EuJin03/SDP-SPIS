# Student Performance Improvement System

## Introduction

This program is built for the UCDF2005ICT(DI) SDP assignment. This system that is being built will focus on helping students to improve their grades by showing what topics in a specific subject that they're weak at. Due to several limitations, not all features that are mentioned will be implemented fully. This student monitoring program created using MERN stack

## Getting started with the project

1. #### `./server/constant.js` folder

- Assign all values required in the `.env` file as mentioned above

2. #### `npm run data:import`

- Import `Course` into database to retrieve course `_id` before seeding other entities.

3. #### `npm run start` or `npm run server`

- Run `node/nodemon index.js` command in bash terminal to run in development mode.
